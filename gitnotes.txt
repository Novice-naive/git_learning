Git notes
1. First create the git depository by : $git init, in a directory
2. use $git add, to add (only one file) to git depository and then use
   $git commit -m "2022.10.7-KeanShen-readme" to submit (all the adding file)
   to the depository. information added after the -m could helpful when 
   finding previous version of file.  
3. use $git status, to check if there is modified but not commit files
4. use $git diff <filename> to look up the modified content
