Git notes
0. After apt-get install git, $git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
1. First create the git depository by : $git init, in a directory
2. use $git add, to add (only one file) to git depository and then use
$git commit -m "2022.10.7-KeanShen-readme" to submit (all the adding file)
to the depository. information added after the -m could helpful when 
finding previous version of file. 
	Note: $git commit could only commit the added file!!!
	Note: if deleted or rename a file, use $git commit -a
	Note: since $git log could tell config name and time, don't
	      add these info in the $git commit -m
	Note: add only submit the file to "stage", commit submit the file to "master"
	      stage is the temporary storage place.  


时光机穿梭
3. use $git status, to check if there is modified but not commit files
4. use $git diff <filename>, to look up the modified content
5. use $git log, to see the previous submit history (has previous version)
6. use $git reflog, to see the command history and future version to jump 
7. use $git reset --hard <version_number> to jump to the previous or future
version of depository
	Note: version_number dont need to complete but at least first five bits
	Note: version_number could be HEAD^(last version), HEAD~100(100geqian)
8. $git checkout -- <file>  or  $git restore <file>  可以丢弃工作区的修改(撤销还未add的error)
    $git reset HEAD <file> or $git restore --staged <file> 可以把暂存区的修改撤销掉（unstage), 
重新放回工作区. 相当于回到了上一行的阶段。
